          <h2>Our Story...</h2>

          <p id="about">Pat, what were you thinking? People from all over have asked me time and time again, why a Salmon flavored Cookie? It doesn't make sense, it sounds gross, like it just shouldn't work. If I were you that's what I'd be saying. But let me convince you otherwise. It started like this: one day, while walking through the beautiful open are market down at Pike Place in Seattle WA, I was eating a cookie and was being over come with all the sugary sweetness. Just as I was contemplating throwing that cookie away I happened to walk by the fish stand where the men throw fish to each other. It also just so happened that a mighty breeze blew up off the Puget Sound and I caught an enormous wiff of fishy goodness, and suddenly that cookie wasn't so sticky sweet. Suddenly I could taste naunce. I stood there and finished my cookie and thought, maybe there's a way to capture that experience and put it into a cookie. Well, five years later here we are, with stores located around the world! What started out as an odd idea has blown up into an international sensation! Everyday we bake our cookies fresh with only the finest ingredients. Nothing fishy going on in our kitchens. If you're not a believer I'd love to convince you. Order online and have the cookies delivered fresh to your door, or find the location closest to you and drop on in; if you get in early enough you might just catch me, fresh off the boat and ready to get baking! <b>~Pat</b></p>
